# Weather App
This is a minimalist web app where you can check weather in any city on the Earth. Just type in the search-bar and with the help of prediction enter your city. The app will show you current weather and forecast for next three days. It includes temperature, description, list of weather with 3 hours interval, humidity, wind, pressure, clouds. Also app has a beautiful darkmode for people who live in darkness.

## Technologies
I didn't use any fancy things for the project. Pure simplicity:

- Vanilla JS
- REST API on node.js

## API

What about APIs, there are some of them in the project, here is the list:

- Open Weather Map
- Google Places Autocomplete
- Google Places Find Place From Text
- Google Places Get Details By Place ID

### Finally
I don't know what to add more, just try the project by your-self [[link]](https://weather.dzakh.dev/).
